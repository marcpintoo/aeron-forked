Efficient reliable UDP unicast, UDP multicast, and IPC message transport. Java, C, and C++ clients are available in this
repository, and a [.NET client](https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/Aeron.NET) is available. All
clients can exchange messages across machines, or on the same machine via IPC, very efficiently. Message streams can be
recorded by the [Archive](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron/tree/master/aeron-archive) module to persistent storage
for later, or real-time, replay. Aeron [Cluster](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron/tree/master/aeron-cluster)
provides support for fault-tolerant services as replicated state machines based on the
[Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm.

Performance is the key focus. A design goal for Aeron is to be the highest throughput with the lowest and most
predictable latency of any messaging system. Aeron integrates with
[Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding) for the best possible message
encoding and decoding performance. Many of the data structures used in the creation of Aeron have been factored out to
the [Agrona](https://github.com/real-logic/agrona) project.

For details of usage, protocol specification, FAQ, etc. please check out the
